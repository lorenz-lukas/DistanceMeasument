# DistanceMeasument
Distance measurement algorithm based on image and ultrasonic sensor
# Requirements:

- Keras with TensorFlow backend

# Repository:
- sparki : it is the code that is used in the robot

- code : it is the main directory. It must follow that structure. It must contain the dataset folder inside (https://gitlab.com/lorenz-lukas/DistanceDataset) 

# Thanks:
- Thanks to Edubot for borrowing the robot sparki.
